### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. When writing a code, the developer will often need to allow the program to perform different decisions based on varying conditions. To achieve this task, the developer can use a conditional statement. With the conditional statement, the developer can tell the program to run a piece of code only if a specified condition is true.
2. The most fundamental conditional statement is an If statement. Having two parts (the conditional part and the code to be run), the statement will evaluate to be either true or false and only run if the statement is true. In other words, an If statement utilizes a question to be asked and executes a specified code only if the asked question evaluates to true.
3. Conditional statements are being used to control program flow. The If statement executes only if the statement evaluates to true. In a situation when the If statement evaluates to false, an Else statement can be applied to move forward to execute alternate code. The Else statement has no condition to be evaluated and is placed after the If (or Else If) statement.
4. To extend the If statement and add more conditions to be evaluated (with a variety of associated code options to be executed), the developer can use an Else If statement. The Else If statement can be used multiple times, or as many times as needed. The program will run all statements in order and will execute the first one that evaluates to true. If none of the Else If statements evaluate to true, then the Else statement will be executed.
